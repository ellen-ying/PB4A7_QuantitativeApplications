\newpage

In the study \emph{Punishment and Deterrence: Evidence from Drunk
Driving} \textbf{(Hansen, 2015)}, Hansen investigated the effect of
punishments and sanctions on reducing repeat drunk driving. The study
implemented a quasi-experimental design, utilising the administrative
records from 1995 to 2011 of the state of Washington, U.S., where two
thresholds of blood alcohol content (BAC) are used to determine the
status of driving under the influence (DUI). Specifically, a driver with
a measured BAC over 0.08 is considered a case of DUI and will be
punished via measures such as fines, jail time, and driving license
suspension. One with a BAC over 0.15 is considered a case of aggravated
DUI, to which more severe punishments and sanctions are applied. Since
BAC measure has clear-cut numeric thresholds for determining whether a
driver will receive harsher punishments, and neither drivers or police
can manipulate this measure, Hansen applied a regression discontinuity
design to analyse the data \textbf{(expand on the justification of using
RDD)}. He hypothesized that receiving harsher punishments and sanctions
at both thresholds would reduce offenders' future recidivism of DUI. He
further applied the RDD to analyse the effect of receiving harsher
punishments on the degree of deterrence, incapacitation, and
rehabilitation in order to identify the mechanism through which harsher
punishments might reduce recidivism \textbf{(check the paper to see
whether this sentence is precise)}.

\textbf{Ideally also the results}

The present study aims to replicate the findings from \textbf{Hansen
(2015)} using regression discontinuity design applied to a similar data
\textbf{(what is it exactly\ldots)}. It will be focused on estimating
the effect of receiving punishments on reducing recidivism at the 0.08
BAC threshold only. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 discusses
the econometric method and assumptions underlying its application to the
current data. Section 2 presents the main results, and Section 3
discusses critiques and extensions to the original study. Section 4
concludes.

\section{Methods and Assumptions}\label{methods-and-assumptions}}

\hypertarget{assumptions-of-the-regression-discontinuity-design}{%
\subsection{Assumptions of the regression discontinuity
design}\label{assumptions-of-the-regression-discontinuity-design}}

The present study applies the regression discontinuity design to the
data provided by the class instructor. Several assumptions need to be
met so that the regression discontinuity design can give accurate
estimates. First, people need to be randomly assigned to receiving
punishment at the BAC threshold. In other words, neither the drivers nor
the police can manipulate the BAC level and thus whether one will
receive punishment. \textbf{Hansen (2015)} has already given a plausible
theoretical justification for this assumption. Empirically, I plot the
distribution of BAC and test for discontinuity in its distribution at
the threshold. Figure \ref{fig:bac_hist_continuous} shows the
distribution of BAC level. Based on a recently developed local
polynomial density estimator \textbf{(CJM, 2020)}, the hypothesis that
the distribution is continuous at 0.08 cannot be rejected at the alpha
level of 0.05 (\emph{p} = 0.890). Therefore, there is no evidence for
the existence of manipulation on the BAC level.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{../figures/bac_histogram_continuous.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{Histogram of blood alcohol content as a continuous variable.} The blood alcohol content is plotted as a continuous variable with a bin width of 0.001, the precision used on the breathalysers. The y-axis represents the frequency of observations in each bin. The vertical black lines represent the two thresholds at 0.08 and 0.15.}
  \label{fig:bac_hist_continuous}
\end{figure}

The second assumption is that the running variable should not contain
non-random heaping, which can lead to biased estimates in regression
discontinuity models \textbf{(Barreca et al., 2011)}. In other words,
BAC should not be much more likely to take certain values than others.
Based on figure \ref{fig:bac_hist_continuous}, this assumption seems to
be violated. Curiously, when BAC is plotted as a discrete variable,
non-random heaping disappears (Figure \ref{fig:bac_hist_discrete}). A
closer inspection of the data suggests that this is probably due to the
lack of precision in BAC in the current data. Many BAC values deviate by
a very small amount from the values that are supposed to be given by the
breathalysers (i.e., precise to three digits after the decimal point).
Some bins have a value at the left boundary deviating upwards and a
value at the right boundary deviating downwards. Such bins will contain
a larger number of observations than other bins and thus leads to
heaping. This would not occur if the data records the values precisely
so that the number of observations are rightly separated into and
plotted by two bins, or if we treat BAC as discrete and give each value
its own bin. \textbf{(consider using a simulation to justify this
claim?)}

\hypertarget{the-model}{%
\subsection{The model}\label{the-model}}

The present study utilises a local linear regression model with a
triangular kernel weight function to estimate the effect of receiving
punishments at the threshold on recidivism. For sensitivity analyses,
the models are re-estimated using second-order polynomials and other
kernel functions (universal and rectangular). The model is specified by
the following function:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:model}
  R_i = \alpha + \beta_1 DUI_i + \beta_2 BAC_i + \beta_3 DUI_i \times BAC_i + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}

where the variable \(DUI_i\) is an indicator of whether BAC is above the
0.08 threshold, \(BAC_i\) is the measure of BAC level, and \(R_i\) is an
indicator of recidivism. The variable \(BAC_i\) in the model is centered
around the threshold value of 0.08.

\hypertarget{inclusion-of-covariates}{%
\subsection{Inclusion of covariates}\label{inclusion-of-covariates}}

In order to determine whether any covariates should be included in the
model, I run preliminary analyses on the effect of receiving punishments
at the threshold on four predetermined characteristics, including three
demographic variables (gender, race, and age) and the BAC test being
conducted in a traffic accident. The analyses use the same local linear
regression model specified in equation (\ref{eqn:model}), with a
bandwidth of 0.05 and no kernel weight function. As Table
\ref{tab:covariate} shows, I fail to reject any of the null hypotheses
that predetermined characteristics remained the same at the threshold.
This indicates that gender, race, age, and the BAC test being conducted
in a traffic accident, on average, were not different between people who
did not receive punishments and those who received punishments at the
threshold. According to \textbf{Calonico et al.~(2019)}, I will include
the four predetermined characteristics in regression discontinuity
models to improve the estimation precision of the effects of receiving
punishments at the threshold on recidivism.
